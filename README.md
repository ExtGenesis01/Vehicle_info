# Vehicle_info

This is my first Major Script so of course there will be some issues on some peoples side. Common issues of the script includes 

Not displaying names of Custom cars (Sorry all base game cars should work)

class not showing Up ? Then maybe head on over to the shared folder and config it 

There are also some dependancys the script need you to have in Order to work

1. Ensure you on a ESX framework server
2. Ensure you have the latest OX_lib - https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib
3. ensure you have a notification system called Bulletin - https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-standalone-bulletin-customisable-notifications/4360505/47 

Usage of the script

In order to use the script all you go to do is drag and drop the folder into your FiveM Resources 

When you have draged it into your resource folder in Game you want to type /vehinfo and the script should tell you all about the vehicle your ped is driving.
